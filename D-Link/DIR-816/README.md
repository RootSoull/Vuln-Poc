# Vulnerability Description
Stack-based buffer overflows found on d-link dir-816 A2 1.10 B05 devices allow arbitrary remote code execution without authentication.Embodied in the /goform/form2userconfig.cgi handler function, long password may lead to stack-based buffer overflow and cover the return address.
# Vulnerability Detail

In the route /goform/form2userconfig.cgi handler.The value of the parameter password is base64 decoded, and the result is stored on the stack.
The vendor only sets a password length limit on the front end, but does not check the password length for POST submission.

There's no check on length of the password, and a very long input could lead to stack overflow and overwrite the return address:

Fortunately, the heap is at fixed address with permission rwx. So we could build a very large HTTP header which contains the shellcode, and set the return address to that shellcode.

After running the poc, we easily get the shell.
